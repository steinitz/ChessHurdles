## Project: TanStack Start + Better Auth Integration

### Accomplishments Today

#### 1. Authentication System Implementation
- **Created temporary auth route workaround** in `src/routes/_app/auth/`
  - `signin.tsx` - imports SignIn component from `~stzUser/components/SignIn`
  - `signup.tsx` - imports signup component from `~stzUser/routes/auth/signup`
  - `requestPasswordReset.tsx` - imports component from `~stzUser/routes/auth/requestPasswordReset`
  - `setNewPassword.tsx` - imports component from `~stzUser/routes/auth/setNewPassword`
  - `verify-email.tsx` - imports VerifyEmail component from `~stzUser/routes/auth/verify-email`
  - `forRouteTroubleshooting.tsx` - imports component from `~stzUser/routes/auth/forRouteTroubleshooting`

- **Resolved TypeScript conflicts** by commenting out `Route` exports in original `stzUser/routes/auth/` files
- **Fixed verify-email component** by removing problematic imports (`@tanstack/react-router`, `better-auth/react`)
- **All auth routes now functional** and accessible through the temporary workaround

#### 2. Technical Improvements
- **Fixed TanStack warning** by adding missing `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` plugin to dependencies
- **Removed duplicate auth routes** to clean up codebase
- **Improved Email Address Verification and Change flows** with better user experience
- **TypeScript compilation successful** (only remaining errors in unrelated API routes)

#### 3. Development Environment
- **Development server running** successfully at `http://localhost:3000/`
- **All auth pages tested** and working correctly
- **Code committed** with comprehensive commit message

├── signin.tsx
├── signup.tsx
├── requestPasswordReset.tsx
├── setNewPassword.tsx
├── verify-email.tsx
└── forRouteTroubleshooting.tsx

├── lib/                      # Auth logic and utilities
└── routes/                   # Original auth routes (Route exports commented)

stzUtils/                     # Utility components
└── components/               # Reusable UI components
```

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Tasks
1. **Refine email-change flow** - Continue improving user experience
2. **Explore Virtual File Routes** - Investigate as a more permanent solution for including `stzUser` routes
3. **Remove temporary workaround** once Virtual File Routes are implemented

#### Future Direction
1. **Begin chess analysis app development** once auth foundation is complete
2. **Implement missed-tactics training features**
3. **User progress tracking and personalization**

### Technical Notes
- The temporary workaround provides a clean separation between the main app routes and the `stzUser` module
- Virtual File Routes may offer a more elegant solution for route inclusion
- The auth system architecture is solid and ready for the chess application

### Development Commands
- `pnpm run dev` - Start development server
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript type checking
- Development server: `http://localhost:3000/`
