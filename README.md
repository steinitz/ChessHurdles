## Chess Analysis Infrastructure

ChessHurdles implements a sophisticated chess game analysis system with real-time evaluation graphs and progressive analysis feedback.

### Core Features

**Game Analysis Engine**
- **Stockfish Integration** - Web Worker-based chess engine for position evaluation
- **Reverse Analysis** - Analyzes moves in reverse chronological order for efficiency
- **Progressive Updates** - Real-time graph updates as analysis proceeds
- **Configurable Scope** - Adjustable number of moves to analyze (useful for testing/development)

**Evaluation Visualization**
- **Interactive Graph** - Visual representation of position evaluations over time
- **Real-time Updates** - Graph bars appear progressively as analysis completes
- **Move Navigation** - Click graph bars to jump to specific game positions
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to container width for optimal display

### Technical Architecture

**Reverse Analysis System**
The key innovation is that the engine benefits from having "seen the future" when analyzing moves:

1. **Strategic Context**: By analyzing moves in reverse order, the engine has knowledge of how the game actually unfolded
2. **Enhanced Evaluation**: This contextual awareness can lead to more nuanced position assessments
3. **Efficient Processing**: Analyze last moves first (e.g., moves 87, then 86) without game replay
4. **Progressive Rendering**: Initialize with nulls, fill positions as analysis completes

**Data Flow**
```
Game Moves → Reverse Analysis → Position Evaluation → Graph Display
    ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓
[1,2,...,87] → [87,86,...] → [eval87,eval86] → [eval86,eval87]
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Components**
- `GameAnalysis.tsx` - Main analysis orchestrator with reverse processing logic
- `EvaluationGraph.tsx` - Interactive visualization component
- `stockfish-engine.ts` - Web Worker integration for chess engine
- `ChessGame.tsx` - Game state management and move navigation

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for component logic and edge cases
- E2E tests for complete analysis workflows
- Configurable move limits for efficient test execution
- Mock engine responses for predictable testing

## Foundation - in stzUser directory

For detailed foundation documentation, see [README-STZUSER.md](./README-STZUSER.md).

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm typecheck    # Check TypeScript types
pnpm test         # Run unit tests
pnpm test:e2e     # Run E2E tests
```

## Project Structure

```

## Ready to Build

This template eliminates weeks of setup time. Fork it, configure your environment variables, and start building your application immediately. The foundation handles authentication, database operations, email workflows, and testing - so you can focus on your unique features.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Follow the Quick Start guide above
3. Customize the foundation in `stzUser/` for your needs
4. Build your application in `src/`
5. Deploy to Vercel with zero configuration

Happy building! 🚀

## Getting Started

1. Update `package.json` with your project details
2. Modify this README with your specific project information
3. Start building your application features
4. Refer to `README-STZUSER.md` for foundation-specific documentation

## Keeping Updated (For Forked Projects)

To pull updates from the original foundation repository into your fork:

```bash
# Check if upstream already exists
git remote -v

# One-time setup (skip if upstream already exists)
git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
# If you get "upstream already exists", you can skip this step

# Regular updates
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep your changes in `src/` directory
- Avoid modifying `stzUser/` and `stzUtils/` when possible
- Test after each update to ensure compatibility

**Note:** If you've modified files in `stzUser/` or `stzUtils/`, you may need to resolve merge conflicts during updates.
