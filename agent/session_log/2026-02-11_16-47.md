## Objective
Consolidate the `ChessGame` header into a single line to save vertical space, remove parentheses from engine levels, and standardize date formatting.

## Actions
- **`chess-utils.ts`**: Added `formatNiceDate` utility for "10 Feb 2026" style dates.
- **`ChessGame.tsx`**:
    - Consolidated `<h2>` and `<p>` into a single `<p>` with `fontWeight: 500`.
    - Format: `Title Description Date` (no hyphens, no parentheses around dates).
    - Added logic to strip leading/trailing parentheses from level labels (e.g., "(Level 5)" -> "Level 5").
- **`GameList.tsx`**: Updated both "Reference Games" and "Saved Games" lists to use the shared `formatNiceDate` utility.

## Results
- UI header is significantly more compact.
- Date formatting is consistent across the application.
- All relevant tests (`EvaluationGraph`, `evaluation-metrics`) passed.
