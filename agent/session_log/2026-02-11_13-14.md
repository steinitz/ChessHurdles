# Session Log: 2026-02-11 13:14

## Context
Restructuring agent metadata and investigating failing tests. All previous unapproved code changes have been reverted using `git reset --hard HEAD`.

## Administrative Actions
- Created `agent/session_log/`
- Moved `agent.md` to `agent/agent.md`
- Updated `reference/GEMINI.md` to point to the `agent/` directory

## Test Investigation Findings
Identified 2 test files failing, both related to local logic in `src/`:

1.  **`EvaluationGraph.test.tsx`**: Fails because the tooltip text is split across multiple `<span>` elements (`0.25` and `Move 10`), but the test uses a single string matcher `screen.getByText`.
2.  **`evaluation-metrics.test.ts`**: Fails because current `WPL_THRESHOLDS` (inaccuracy: 0.15, mistake: 0.25) are higher than the test's expectations (inaccuracy: 0.09, mistake: 0.18).

**Conclusion**: These are local project issues (regression/mismatch), not upstream issues in `stzUser` or `stzUtils`.
