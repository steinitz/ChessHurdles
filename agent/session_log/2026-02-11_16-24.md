## Objective
Fix local test failures in `EvaluationGraph.test.tsx` and `evaluation-metrics.test.ts` identified during previous research.

## Actions
- **`evaluation-metrics.ts`**: Updated `WPL_THRESHOLDS` (inaccuracy: 0.09, mistake: 0.18) to align with test expectations and standard Lichess metrics.
- **`EvaluationGraph.test.tsx`**: Replaced rigid `screen.getByText` string matchers with a flexible function matcher to find text split across multiple `<span>` elements.
- **Verification**: Ran `pnpm vitest` for both files.

## Results
- All 13 tests passed successfully.
- No upstream changes required; fixes were purely local to the project's logic and test resilience.
