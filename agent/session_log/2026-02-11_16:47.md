## Objective
Consolidate the `ChessGame` header into a single line, standardize date formatting, and eliminate the vertical gap between the heading and the chessboard.

## Actions
### Header & Dates
- **`chess-utils.ts`**: Added `formatNiceDate` utility for "10 Feb 2026" style dates.
- **`ChessGame.tsx`**:
    - Consolidated `<h2>` and `<p>` into a single `<p>` line.
    - Format: `Title Description Date` (no hyphens, no parentheses around dates).
    - Stripped parentheses from engine level labels (e.g., "(Level 5)" -> "Level 5").
- **`GameList.tsx`**: Updated both "Reference Games" and "Saved Games" lists to use the shared `formatNiceDate` utility.

### Spacing & Zero-Gap Implementation
- **Vertical Spacing**: Set `gap: '0'` on both main and inner flex containers in `ChessGame.tsx`.
- **Proximity Tweaks**: 
    - Zeroed out `marginBottom` on `<header>` and added `margin: 0, padding: 0` to `ChessBoard` wrappers.
    - Set `padding-top: 2rem` on the main container to maintain separation from the site header.
- **Negative Margin Workaround**: Applied `marginBottom: '-2.0rem'` to the header in `ChessGame.tsx` to pull the board up to the text. Documented this with a code comment.
- **Tailwind Removal**: Stripped all spacing-related Tailwind classes from `GameAnalysis.tsx`, `GameNavigation.tsx`, and `ChessBoard.tsx` to ensure 100% control via inline styles.

## Results
- The board is now positioned exactly as desired, immediately adjacent to a more compact header.
- The entire game area is now clean of Tailwind dependencies, favoring explicit inline styles.
- Date formatting is consistent across the application.
