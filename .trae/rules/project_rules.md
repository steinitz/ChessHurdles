Acknowledged your plan to eventually replace the current EmailTester mock approach with a lightweight local SMTP dev server for E2E tests. This would allow sendEmail to use actual SMTP configuration from .env.test instead of mocking. The current implementation with EmailTester works well for testing purposes, and the Ethereal dependency can be removed later since it's not the local server solution you're looking for.
